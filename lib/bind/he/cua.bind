# This is the CUA (Common User Access) flavour bind file, based on
# bindings found in the Windows, Mac and Motif world, extended for Hebrew.

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS DEFAULT BINDING FILE! It will be replaced
# with every new install of LyX and your changes will be lost.
# Instead, customize a copy of this file placed in
# ~/.lyx/bind/he/cua.bind
#
# Happy tuning!

# Load the default cua.bind
# ../ just means that no localized bindfile
# should be loaded here
Format 5

\bind_file ../cua.bind

# Add binding to switch to Hebrew
\bind "F12" "language hebrew"
